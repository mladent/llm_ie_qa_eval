# AI Agents Best Practices Guide

## Overview

Guidelines for AI agents working on software development tasks.
Focusing exclusibvely on non-obvious patterns, agent-specific workflows, and integration best practices.

This guide is CLAUDE-first. The decision framework from CLAUDE.md is the primary operating policy for this repository. When guidance conflicts, follow the CLAUDE-first rules below.

Based on research from ["On the Impact of AGENTS.md Files on the Efficiency of AI Coding Agents"](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.20404v1), this guide documents patterns that significantly improve AI agent productivity in software development workflows.

## 0. CLAUDE-First Operating Rules (Highest Priority)

### 0.1 Think Before Coding

- State assumptions explicitly before implementation when requirements are ambiguous.
- If multiple interpretations are plausible, present options instead of picking silently.
- Name uncertainty directly; do not hide confusion.
- Prefer clarifying questions when ambiguity changes implementation risk.

### 0.2 Simplicity First

- Implement the minimum code needed to satisfy the request.
- Do not add speculative flexibility, extensibility, or configuration.
- Do not add features not requested by the user.
- Avoid over-engineering; rewrite bloated solutions into simpler ones.

### 0.3 Surgical Changes

- Touch only files and code paths required for the task.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Match existing style and conventions in touched files.
- Remove only dead code introduced by your own edits, not pre-existing unrelated code.

### 0.4 Goal-Driven Verification

- Define explicit success criteria before coding.
- For bug fixes, reproduce the failure path and verify the fix.
- For feature changes, verify behavior with focused tests and realistic sample data.
- Treat completion as "implemented + verified", not just "code written".

## 1. Coding Best Practices

### 1.1 Architecture Patterns

**Key Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Pure functions for transformations, orchestration functions for I/O
- **Factory Pattern**: Use for extensible model creation
- **Configuration Objects**: Use dataclasses with explicit dependencies (avoid global config)
- **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs at function entry with actionable error messages
- **Type Hints**: Add to all function signatures

### 1.2 Error Handling

- Provide actionable error messages (e.g., "No data found. Run: python main.py --prepare")
- Validate at system boundaries (API endpoints, file I/O, model inputs)
- Use graceful degradation with fallback values where appropriate

### 1.3 Function Length and Complexity

**Length Guidelines:**
- **20-50 lines**: Ideal range
- **50-75 lines**: Consider refactoring
- **Over 100 lines**: Strong refactoring signal

**Red Flags Indicating Split Needed:**
- Multiple levels of nested loops/conditionals (>3 levels)
- Many local variables (>7-10)
- Multiple distinct responsibilities
- Hard to name accurately (contains "and", "or", "then")
- Difficult to write concise docstring

**Refactoring Techniques:**
- **Extract Method**: Break into focused helper functions
- **Compose Functions**: Chain transformations with `.pipe()` or function composition
- **Helper Functions**: Extract complex conditionals

**Acceptable Exceptions:**
- Well-documented complex algorithms (single cohesive algorithm)
- Configuration/setup functions (many options, single logical operation)
- Switch/case routing logic (single responsibility despite length)

### 1.4 Code Brevity Principle

**Write the shortest code feasible to achieve the goal**
- Prioritize conciseness and minimal line count
- Eliminate unnecessary verbosity and redundant operations
- Use language idioms and built-in functions that reduce code length
- Never introduce speculative abstractions for single-use logic

**Maintain Essential Practices:**
- Comments and docstrings (still required for clarity)
- Readability conventions (indentation, spacing, line breaks)
- Descriptive variable/function names

---

## 2. Documentation Best Practices

### 2.1 Docstring Essentials

- Document public APIs with Args, Returns, Raises
- Skip obvious getters/setters
- Comment the "why" not the "what"
- Add comments for: complex algorithms, performance optimizations, workarounds, business logic

### 2.2 Documentation File Policy

**Avoid Creating New .md Files**
- **DO NOT** create new markdown documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Documentation belongs in code: docstrings, comments, and README.md
- Exception: Project already has established documentation structure

**Where to Document:**
```
✅ In-code docstrings for functions/classes
✅ README.md for project overview and usage
✅ Inline comments for complex logic
✅ Existing .md files if they already exist

❌ New .md files for every feature
❌ Separate documentation for small changes
❌ Summary documents after implementations
❌ "Change log" markdown files
```

## 3. Testing Best Practices

- **Test Pyramid**: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e
- Test: happy path, edge cases, error conditions
- Use pytest fixtures for reusability
- Use parametrized tests for coverage
- Skip testing: library code, trivial getters/setters

---

## 4. AI Agent Workflow Best Practices

### 4.1 Context Gathering Protocol

**Before Writing Code - Research Phase**
1. `semantic_search("relevant concept")` - Find similar implementations
2. `read_file()` on key files - Understand existing patterns
3. `grep_search("function_name")` - Find all usages
4. `list_code_usages("ClassName")` - See how it's used

**Example Workflow:**
```
Task: Add summary tables to k-fold validation example

1. semantic_search("model evaluation metrics aggregation")
   → Found: src/recommendation_engine.py has fit_all_with_kfold()

2. read_file(recommendation_engine.py, lines with metrics)
   → Metrics structure: {model: {metric: value, std_metric: value}}

3. grep_search("format.*table") 
   → Check if table formatting exists elsewhere

4. Now ready to implement with full context
```

### 4.2 Incremental Implementation

**Build → Test → Enhance Cycle**
```
Step 1: Minimal implementation
  ├─ Create function stub with type hints
  ├─ Add basic logic
  └─ Test with get_errors()

Step 2: Core functionality
  ├─ Implement main algorithm
  ├─ Add input validation
  └─ Test with sample data

Step 3: Enhancement
  ├─ Add error handling
  ├─ Optimize performance
  └─ Add unit/comprehensive tests
```

**Execution Guardrails:**
- Stop and clarify if requirements are ambiguous enough to change implementation.
- Prefer smallest viable change first, then iterate.
- Do not add optional behavior unless requested.

### 4.3 Verification Checklist

**After Implementation - Always Run:**
- [ ] `get_errors(filePath)` - No syntax errors
- [ ] Check imports are available
- [ ] Verify function signatures match usage
- [ ] Test with realistic sample data
- [ ] Check edge cases (empty, None, invalid)
- [ ] Verify outcome against explicit success criteria defined at task start

**Integration Verification:**
- [ ] New code follows existing patterns
- [ ] Naming conventions match codebase
- [ ] Configuration is consistent
- [ ] Error handling aligns with project style

### 4.4 Multi-File Changes

**Dependency Order Matters**
```
When modifying multiple files:
1. Update base classes/interfaces first
2. Update implementations second
3. Update call sites third
4. Update tests last

Use multi_replace_string_in_file for atomicity
```

### 4.5 Environment Setup

**Virtual Environment Best Practice**
- **Always activate the project's virtual environment** before running code or tests
- This ensures imports, dependencies, and tests align with the project's requirements

**Check for venv:**
```bash
# Look for venv directory
ls -la | grep venv

# If exists, activate it:
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

**Workflow Integration:**
```
Before running any Python commands:
1. Check if venv exists in project
2. Activate venv if present
3. Verify activation: `which python` should point to venv
4. Then proceed with testing/development
```

## 5. Common Patterns & Anti-Patterns

### 5.1 DRY Principle Applied

Extract repetitive logic into reusable functions. If you see the same code block repeated with minor variations, extract it into a function that handles all cases.

### 5.2 Type-Safe Returns

Use dataclasses for structured returns instead of dicts - provides type safety and IDE support.

### 5.3 Configuration Injection

Avoid global configuration. Pass config objects explicitly as function parameters for testability and clarity.

## 6. Project-Specific Guidelines

### 6.1 This E-Commerce Recommendation Project

**Key Patterns Used:**
- Engine pattern: `BundleRecommendationEngine` orchestrates multiple models
- Pipeline pattern: `DataPipeline` for ETL operations
- Configuration: `config/settings.yaml` for prompts and schemas
- Caching: JSON files for expensive LLM operations
- Examples: Separate files for different use cases

**When Adding Features:**
1. Check if similar pattern exists (cross-sell, category enrichment)
2. Follow the example file naming: `examples_*.py`
3. Use existing caching mechanisms where appropriate
4. Add documentation to relevant `*_README.md` files

## 8. Agent Communication Best Practices

**Progress Reporting:**
- Report findings during research phase
- Explain key design decisions
- Highlight trade-offs or limitations
- Confirm completion with evidence

**When to Ask for Clarification:**
- Ambiguous requirements with multiple valid interpretations
- Conflicts with existing patterns
- Missing dependencies or data

**When to Proceed Autonomously:**
- Clear implementation path exists
- Following established patterns
- Standard error handling

---

## 9. Version Control Best Practices

**Commit Message Structure:**
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive, imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Commit code and documentation files in separate commits
- Keep subject under 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how
- Reference issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- **NO emoticons or emojis**
- NO vague messages ("fix stuff", "updates", "wip")
- Only when making documentation-only commits, the `--no-verify` flag may be used: `git commit --no-verify -m "docs: <message>"`

**Branch Naming:**
- `feature/<description>`, `fix/<description>`, `test/<description>`, `docs/<description>`, `refactor/<description>`
- QA/Integration: `qa`, `staging`, `integration`, `develop`
